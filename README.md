## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This is my personal Laravel learning playground.  
Iâ€™m following the **[Laracasts: 30 Days to Learn Laravel 11](https://laracasts.com/series/30-days-to-learn-laravel-11)** tutorial series.

Iâ€™m building everything using **Laravel Sail** (Docker) as my development environment.  
Think of this repo as my Laravel growth diary. ðŸŒ±

## ðŸ—“ Learning Log

> **Note:** Earlier learnings (yesterday, yesterday-yesterday, etc.) will be added later â€” for now, logging starts from today.

### ðŸ“Œ Entry 1 â€” *Refactor grids data into a model with driver lookup and 404 handling*
**Commit:** `refactor: move grids data to model with driver lookup and 404 handling`

**What I learned:**
- Moved hardcoded driver data from routes into a **Model** for better organization.
- Added **static methods** (`driver()` and `findDriver()`) to encapsulate logic.
- Used `Arr::first()` to find specific data by key.
- Handled missing data gracefully with `abort(404)`.
- Learned more about **encapsulation** and separating concerns in Laravel.
- Continued working entirely with **Laravel Sail & Docker** for development.
- Practiced running commands and testing code inside the Sail container.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Entry 2 â€” *Create migration for grids table*
**Commit:** `feat: create grids table migration`

**What I learned:**
- How to create a new migration using Laravelâ€™s **Sail artisan** command.
- Defined a `grids` table with:
    - `driver_name` (string) for storing the driver's full name.
    - `constructor` (string) for storing the team name.
    - `path` (string) for storing the image file path.
- Added timestamps to track record creation and updates.
- Understood how migrations provide a version-controlled database schema.
- Ran and tested migrations using **Laravel Sail & Docker**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Entry 3 â€” *Integrate database with Eloquent ORM & Constructor table*
**Commit:** `feat: migrate Grids data to DB with Constructor table & Eloquent models`

**What I learned:**
- Migrated data from hardcoded arrays into **database tables**.
- Created a new `constructor` table and linked it to the `grids` table using a foreign key (`constructor_id`).
- Learned the basics of **Eloquent ORM** for interacting with database tables as models.
- Practiced using **Artisan Tinker** (Laravelâ€™s interactive REPL for testing code directly in the terminal).
- Manipulated table data (create, read, update, delete) inside Tinker.
- Generated and tested **fake data** using Laravel Factories.
- Continued using **Laravel Sail & Docker** for all migrations and commands.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Entry 4 â€” *Add Eloquent relationships, eager loading, and custom pagination*
**Commit:** `feat: add Eloquent relationships, eager loading, and custom pagination views`

**What I learned:**
- Implemented many-to-many relationships with **pivot tables** in Eloquent.
- Solved **N+1 query** issues by switching from `Grid::all()` to `Grid::with('relation')->get()`.
- Added **pagination** to grid listings.
- Published vendor pagination views using `artisan vendor:publish` to customize pagination link styles.
- Updated Blade templates to display related data efficiently.
- Learned how eager loading improves performance in relational queries.
