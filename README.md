## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This is my personal Laravel learning playground.  
Iâ€™m following the **[Laracasts: 30 Days to Learn Laravel 11](https://laracasts.com/series/30-days-to-learn-laravel-11)** tutorial series.  

Here, I practice what I learn â€” committing small but meaningful changes while applying best practices.  
Think of this repo as my Laravel growth diary. ðŸŒ±

## ðŸ—“ Learning Log

> **Note:** Learnings from earlier days (yesterday, yesterday-yesterday, and so on) will be added later â€” for now, logging starts from today.

**Commit:** `refactor: move grids data to model with driver lookup and 404 handling`  
- How to move hardcoded data from routes into a **Model** for better organization.
- Defining **static methods** (`driver()` and `findDriver()`) to encapsulate behavior.
- Using `Arr::first()` to retrieve specific data by a given key.
- Handling unexpected cases with `abort(404)` and letting Laravel automatically turn that into a proper HTTP response.
- A bit about **encapsulation** and separating concerns in Laravel.
